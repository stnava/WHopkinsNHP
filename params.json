Left-right mirrored volumes images were subtracted from the grey matter thickness volumes in their normal orientation. A whole brain, voxel-by-voxel t-test analysis was then performed on the difference volumes.  The difference volume was thresholded at t = 4.00, p < .001; thus, all colors reflect t-values that exceed 4.0. Variation in color intensity reflects the absolute t-value. \r\n\r\n![Supp. Figure 2](http://github.com/stnava/WHopkinsNHP/blob/master/figures/Slide2.png?raw=true)\r\nFigure 2:  Eight transverse views of the difference volume and associated t-values at different levels along the dorsal-ventral plane of the cortex.   Color intensities reflect the absolute t-values (see Figure 1 captions for description). \r\n\r\n![Supp. Figure 3](http://github.com/stnava/WHopkinsNHP/blob/master/figures/Slide3.png?raw=true)\r\nFigure 3:  Eight coronal views of the difference volume and associated t-values at different points along the anterior-posterior axis.
